# Employee Churn Analysis Project
Welcome to the "Employee Churn Analysis Project". This is the project where you can create your own classification models for various business environments.

Exploratory data analysis and visualization of the employee churn dataset using matplotlib and seaborn, model creation and evaluation using python scikit-learn and Tensorflow-Keras packages.
Implemented classification techniques in Python. Using Scikit-Learn, predictions were successfully made for this project with Distance Based, Bagging, Boosting algorithms. On the other hand, Tensorflow-Keras was used for Deep Learning.

At the end of the project, the model was deployed using Streamlit.
